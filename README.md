# SumoLib

This library provides higher level interface to [Sumologic](https://www.sumologic.com/) Search API. Sumologic is a wonderful system to ingest and process textual logs for systems monitoring, debugging, telemetery and log insights.

Sumologic provides REST based [Search Apis](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/Search-Job-API/About-the-Search-Job-API) to fire the queries on your log data.

The APIs are bit tricky and requires stateful communication of three request-response pairs. The method is outlined [here](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/Search-Job-API/About-the-Search-Job-API#process-flow).

SumoLib hides all this complexity and provides the `IEnumerable<T>` to process the results using LINQ / loops.

## End Point Details

Sumologic provides REST API [endpoints](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/General-API-Information/Sumo-Logic-Endpoints-and-Firewall-Security) which would be specific to your account, so please contact your account admin for getting the correct API Url. 

The API endpoing is protected using Access ID and Access Key, which could be generated by following [instructions](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Security/Access-Keys) given in Sumologic help

Once you have all three : API URL, Access ID, and Access Key. SumoLib can be configured to use them.,

```
using SumoLib;
using SumoLib.Config;

var config = new EndPointConfig("accessId","accessKey","apiUrl");

SumoClient.SetupDefault(config);
```

In case if you don't want to use the same config for entier runtime of your app, you could also pass the config optionally as shown in below examples.
